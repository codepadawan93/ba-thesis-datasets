Smart City is the city that connects the people to everything that?s most important to make their lives easier. Through the Alba Iulia Smart City Pilot Project the city and its citizens benefit from the advantages provided by the new and innovative technologies. Alba Iulia Smart City is a project through which companies from various fields, especially IT, creative and communications industries are testing intelligent solutions that meet the diverse needs of the local community. On the one hand, through this way of collaboration the citizens are benefiting from new services and from immediate or indirect benefits provided by the intelligent solutions that are being tested, and the municipality develops future plans and strategies, being endowed with concrete data and tangible benefits of the solutions tested. On the other hand, companies, start-ups, academic actors or other partner entities have the opportunity to ?try? the performance of their products and services in a real environment, thus having the opportunity to build a scalable business model, which can be replicated in any other city from Romania or abroad. Through the Smart City pilot project, we aim to increase the quality of our inhabitants? lives and to show that the infrastructure of future cities will not mean only the basic utilities with which a city operates. The widespread use of smart technologies transforms communities as a whole and also the way in which people interact with their own city. These are, in fact, the premises of a smart city: the channeling of technological advantages towards the concrete needs of the city and the possibility for citizens to make the most of the implemented solutions, either directly or indirectly. With the occasion of celebrating the Centenary Year in Alba Iulia ? ?The city where the future was born? ? we will place the digital foundation for another 100 years of Romania, celebrating 100 years of living history. Alba Iulia deserves to become a more communicative, business-friendly city, more integrative for better ergonomics and mobility, more accessible due to the intelligent solutions, more competitive, creative, efficient, productive and more inclusive for citizens. All the above mentioned will contribute, with the involvement of smart technologies, to the improvement of the  quality of life, improving public services and making the relationship between the community and municipality more transparent.

Alba Iulia (Romanian pronunciation: [?alba ?juli.a] (About this soundlisten); German: Karlsburg or Carlsburg, formerly Wei?enburg, Hungarian: Gyulafeh?rv?r, Latin: Apulum,[2] Ottoman Turkish: Erdel Belgrad? or Belgrad-? Erdel) is the seat of Alba County in the west-central part of Romania. Located on the Mure? River in the historical region of Transylvania, it has a population of 63,536 (as of 2011).[3] Since the High Middle Ages, the city has been the seat of Transylvania's Roman Catholic diocese. Between 1541 and 1690 it was the capital of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and the latter Principality of Transylvania. At one point it also was a center of Eastern Orthodox Metropolitan of Transylvania with suffragan to Vad diocese.[4][5] Alba Iulia is historically important for Romanians, Hungarians, and Transylvanian Saxons. In December 2018, Alba Iulia was officially declared Capital of the Great Union of Romania.[6] The city administers four villages: B?r?ban? (Borb?nd), Mice?ti (Ompolykisfalud), Oarda (Als?v?radja) and P?cli?a (Poklos).
The Alba Carolina Citadel (Romanian: Cetatea Alba Carolina) is a star-shaped Romanian fortress located in Alba Iulia.[2][3][4][5][6][7] Its construction commenced on November 4, 1715 during the Habsburg rule in Transylvania, and was completed in 1738. 20,000 serfs were involved in its construction, which is estimated to have cost around 3 million guldens. The citadel was built on the site of 2 other fortifications? the legionary fortress of Legio XIII Gemina, as well as the medieval Balgrad citadel.

Back in the XVIII century, when the Marquis de Vauban designed and implemented a revolutionary system of fortifications and defenses, little did he know that his designs would earn him international recognition throughout the centuries, as today there are tens of citadels built by the system that bears his name. One of the most spectacular such fortresses of this type is Alba Carolina ? the largest citadel in Romania, located in the city of Alba Iulia. Such is the complexity of this ample landmark that, for the sake of convenience, visits to the citadel have been organized into six separate tours, each with a theme of its own. One of these tours is dedicated to the heroic figures of Horea, Closca, and Crisan, leaders of a major peasant revolt of the XVIII century. It includes the prison cell that Horea was detained in, embedded in the pedestal of the grand statue representing the Austrian emperor Carol VI ? erected at Gate III of the Alba Carolina citadel ? as well as the gaols, located on the south-eastern flank of the Eugene of Savoy bastion, complete with the scaffold where Horea and Closca were executed on a breaking wheel. Another tour walks visitors through the seven gates of the Vaubam citadel, as well as the various constructions of historical importance located nearby. Each of the gates has something worthy to be noted: Gate I, for instance, is beautifully shaped as a triumphal arch; Gate II has three entries, open in the upper half; Gate III, the largest and most impressive of them, is decorated with intricate carvings on both facades; Gate IV is the only one of the west side gates that was honored with Baroque style decorations; Gate V, built in a deceptively simple style, is completed by a bridge that connects the Saint Michael ravelin to the counterguard; Gate VI has earned its fame as the King?s Gate since it served as entry to king Ferdinand and queen Mary on their coronation day; finally, Gate VII, which was only recently uncovered, is a massive tunnel that was used both for procurement purposes and to allow the cavalry to exit the citadel in large numbers when urgent action was required. A third and fourth tour focus on the southern and northern sides of the defense moat surrounding the fortress, which constitutes a genuine dendrological park thanks to the over 70 species of plants and shrubs growing here. The northern tour has the added attraction of two superbly landscaped gardens, a Roman one and a Japanese one, as well as a statue of a XVIII century drummer. However, by far the most spectacular of all the sights is the star-shaped citadel itself, a monumental construction that can be visited in its entire splendor in the tour of the three fortifications. To go on this tour is to enjoy is like enjoying a live lesson in history and military engineering. The three fortifications that give the tour its name refer to the fact that, as it stands today, the Alba Carolina citadel is a series of three successive constructions, each of them incorporating fragments from the previous one. The oldest is the Roman castrum, followed by the medieval stronghold, further expanded in the XVIII century into a Vauban citadel. The mastermind of this latter project was prince Eugene of Savoy, who, however, failed to complete the construction, choosing to redirect funds towards other fortifications before having erected the fourth line of defense. Further works were carried out towards the end of the XVIII century under the supervision of general Bohn, but these too were interrupted before reaching their full completion.

The gentle climate and the richness of the soil made the area around Alba Iulia inhabitable since ancient times and established Alba as a leading wine growing region since 1st century AD. Northwest of Alba Iulia are the Apuseni Mountains and in the east the Transylvanian Plateau with its rolling hills and deep, wide valleys. Alba IuliaOne of the oldest settlements in Romania, known in ancient time as Apulum, Alba Iulia served as the largest military and economic center during the Roman occupation. Temples, mosaics, thermae and statues, amphitheaters, the governor's palace "Daciarum Trium" ? all rendered the original Dacian Apulul as the miniature copy of the mother Rome. An Episcopal citadel and an important political, military and cultural center, Alba Iulia reached its peak between 1542-1690, serving as the capital of the independent Principality of Transylvania and the residence of the Transylvanian princes. In 1599, Mihai Viteazul (Michael the Brave) achieved here for a brief period of time the union of the three main provinces of Romania: Walachia, Transylvania, and Moldavia. The town later became an important printing centre. Nowadays the local universities continue the tradition of the old academic schools. The peasant revolt led by Horea, Closca and Crisan, executed on February 28, 1785 on the Pitchfork Hill (Dealul Furcii) turned the city into a symbol of the fight for justice and freedom. It was here that on December 1st 1918 the province of Transylvania announced its unification with Romania. In 1922 Prince Ferdinand was crowned King of Romania in an act which mirrored the union achieved more than four centuries earlier by Mihai Viteazul.

A resort (North American English) is a self-contained commercial establishment that tries to provide most of a vacationer's wants, such as food, drink, lodging, sports, entertainment, and shopping, on the premises. The term resort may be used for a hotel property that provides an array of amenities, typically including entertainment and recreational activities. A hotel is frequently a central feature of a resort, such as the Grand Hotel at Mackinac Island, Michigan. Some resorts are also condominium complexes that are timeshares or owed fractionally or wholly owned condominium. A resort is not always a commercial establishment operated by a single company, but in the late 20th century, that sort of facility became more common.

Neferneferuaten Nefertiti (/?n?f?r?ti?ti/[3]) (c. 1370?? c. 1330 BC) was an Egyptian queen and the Great Royal Wife (chief consort) of Akhenaten, an Egyptian Pharaoh. Nefertiti and her husband were known for a religious revolution, in which they worshiped one god only, Aten, or the sun disc. With her husband, she reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of Ancient Egyptian history.[4] Some scholars believe that Nefertiti ruled briefly as Neferneferuaten after her husband's death and before the accession of Tutankhamun, although this identification is a matter of ongoing debate.[5][6] If Nefertiti did rule as Pharaoh, her reign was marked by the fall of Amarna and relocation of the capital back to the traditional city of Thebes.[7]
